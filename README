Hi open world!

Some years ago i wrote this toy. Basically it use Arnold to replace Nuke's scanline renderer.
It compile and run on Nuke 8.0vX and Arnold 4.1.x.x under Linux with Eclipse.

Working Nuke nodes:
Cube
ReadGeo
Sphere
DirectLight
Point
Spotlight
Camera
ntoaStandard
ntoaShadowCatcher

Current limitation:
 Motion blur and IPR doesn't work for the moment. While getting motion blur should come soon with Alembic support, IPR might take some times.
 Some parameters or Options are missing.
 
This code is NOT in a state to be used in production yet.

Hope this help and if possible try to contribute back to the code :)

20140606 :
 - Major code cleaning and refactoring
 - The shadow catcher is no longer apply automatically and come with it's own node like ntoaStandard
 - More Arnold's option implemented
 - Various bug fixes
 - Render size is no longer limited to 640*480
 - Sequence rendering works

20140602 :
 Code cleaning!!!
 This version of the code is a bit cleaner and missing parts have been added. Now it should compile with Nuke 8.0 and Arnold 4.1.x
and "kind of" work.
 I have added a sample scene. Since the code is not very stable please reconnect the viewer to the Merge. Wait for the full render to
finish (buckets update crash nuke for now) and tadaaa, working proof of concept.
 For now there's a limitation to 640x480 hardcoded. I'll remove it in the next push.
