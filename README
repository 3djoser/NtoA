Hi open world!

Some years ago i wrote this toy. Basically it's an Arnold replacement for Nuke's scanline renderer.
I've played around the code for two weeks and never had the time to return to it. Since I don't have
access to Nuke anymore and because from time to time someone ask me about NtoA. Because i believe
that there is room for that kind of tool and I would like to contribute back to the open world.
I commit this code as is. You might found some comments in French (prints are in English...) I'm
almost sure that Arnold part won't compile since the API have changed and I didn't know for the Nuke part.
But all in all it worked at some point in the time. It was reading .ass and rendering it in a Nuke graph.
It was also able to get geometry, lights and the camera from a Nuke graph. It was comming with an AiStandard
equivalent and a Shadow caster that was taking GI in account. Even if I'm pretty sure that it can't work in batch
and i was getting segfaults because Arnold's updates was too fast for Nuke's viewport, well it may help someone as a
starting point.

So hope this help and if possible try to contribute back to the code.

PS: It come with a eclipse cproject. I was using Helios at that time...
